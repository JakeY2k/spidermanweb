        <li><center><b>Filming officially began on January 8, 2001 For Sam Raimi's First Spider-Man Movie. In the eyes of Fans and critics alike, it was clear that Sam was an expert in understanding the art of the 
            Spider-Man Character. Growing up, he read multiple spider-man comics making him very familiar with the source material. He also ran with the idea of making Peter Parker (Spider-Man) a symbol for children, while dealing with
            fairly adult themes like loss, regret, relationship problems and daily life struggles such as paying bills and finding employment. These were the first super hero films, despite its goofiness, to drive into sensitive subjects and wasnt afraid to be somewhat mature. </b></center></li>

   <li> <center><b> As of 2020, Sam Raimi's next film project is set to be a great return to the glory days of his career in the form of the "Superhero film genre" which he has not directed a picture in since, you guessed it, "Spider-Man 3" in 2007, the last installment in the Trilogy. He has taken on the role of director for the nect "Doctor Strange" film, which is being refered to as "Doctor Strange 2" or "In the Multiverse of Madness". Coincidentally, This news was predicted many years ago.. by Sam Raimi himself in 2004's "Spider-Man 2!". During a conversation between J. Jonah Jameson (Daily Bugle Newspaper) and an employee, they try to come up with a catchy name to use in headlines for the new villian that has just arrived in New York City. Before landing on "Doc Ock", the employee funnily suggests to Jameson the name "Doctor Strange" before he replies that its good, but its "taken". The film plans to release in the year 2021.  </b> </center></li>
